Make Bacon with React & Firebase
================================

This is the companion repository to [React, Firebase & Bacon](https://frontarm.com/bacon) -- a complete guide to building a real-world app with React.

Each branch within this repository contains code for one or more steps within the course. [See an outline and installation instructions at the master branch &raquo;](https://github.com/frontarm/react-firebase-bacon)


Step 046 - Filesystem structure
--------

This step makes the following changes:

- Splits the `components.js` file into a `components` directory with a number of different files.
- Adds a `globalStyles.js` file for the app's global styles.
- Moves the image files into a `media` directory.
- Adds an `jsconfig.json` file, which among other things, tells Create React App that it should look in the `src` folder for modules that it can't find in `node_modules`.
